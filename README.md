## PROJECT 1: [International Debt Statistics Analysis (SQL)](https://github.com/festusaigbogun/SQL_Data_Analysis/blob/main/International%20Debt%20Statistic%20Analysis/Analyzing_International_Debt.ipynb)
In this project, we are going to analyze international dept data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owned by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to questions like:
What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset? Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like? What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## PROJECT 2: [Analyzing Website Performance Using GA4 & Looker Studio](https://github.com/festusaigbogun/Analyzing_Website_Performance) 

Welcome to a comprehensive analysis of website performance throughout the year. This project delves into crucial metrics impacting our online presence, including user engagement, traffic sources, and conversion rates. By leveraging the robust capabilities of Google Analytics 4 and Looker Studio, I've navigated through intricate data landscapes to derive actionable insights. Using Google analytics 4 demo account to get the data needed for this project since I don't have a website that has been tagged, then I proceeded with using Google looker studio to create the dashboard.
